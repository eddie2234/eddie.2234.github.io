        <li>"Programming Your Mind for Success" by Carrie Green is an inspiring video to watch as it talks about overcoming the negative thoughts one may have in their mind. She starts off the video by having a volunteer come up to the stage, which was later revealed to be an experiment that demonstrates the thoughts one had when she asked for a volunteer. She goes further into depth about the personal challenges she faced while discovering what it was she wanted to do with her life. She explains how she turned her negative thoughts off and instead filled her mind with positive ones that eventually drove her to start her online networking group for female entrepreneurs. Lastly, she explains how she had to keep on visualizing success to gain the motivation to turn her visualizations into reality. </li>

        <li>"Hi, I'm Scott" by Scott Mescudi is one of my favorite Ted talks I have found while searching for some. Scott Mescudi dives in headfirst talking about his life growing up and talks about how he became a successful artist. He explains how becoming an artist was his last option and how he wanted to succeed in his academic life first, although he was never really good at school. He goes into depth as far as talking about the struggles he faced in the process of becoming an artist and talks about his living situation during his time in New York. Also, he talks about his work ethic that drove his success and the type of mindset that it took to get where he wanted to be. Lastly, he also mentions that his one piece of advice to everyone is that "We are all the commanders of our destiny."  </li>

        <p>"5 Hindrances to Self Mastery" by Shi Heng Yi is one of the most eye-opener Ted Talks I came across when searching for some. In the Buddhist tradition, the 5 Hindrances are referred to as the mental factors that hinder progress in our lives. </p>
        
                                <li>Hindrance #1 - Sensual Desire</li>
                                <li>Hindrance #2 - Ill will/Aversion</li>
                                <li>Hindrance #3 - Dullness/Heaviness</li>
                                <li>Hindrance #4 - Restlessness</li>
                                <li>Hindrance #5 - Sceptical Doubt<li>
                                
        <p>Shi Heng Yi talks about how gaining clearity gives room for better decisions and gives us four ways to overcome the 5 Hindrances.</p>
                                
                                <1i>#1 - Recognize what state of the mind you are in.</li>
                                <1i>#2 - Learn to accept, acknowledge, and allow the sitution to be the way that it is.</li>
                                <1i>#3 - Investigate your emotional and mental state. Ask questions like why did it come up and what are the consequences for          remaining in that state of mind.</li>
                                <1i>#4 - Non identity is the practices of "I'm not the body, mind, and emotion." It's more about realizing that your life is          to unique and that one must master themselves.</li>
                            
        <p>Overall, Shi Heng Yi went in-depth as far as how one must learn to be mentally strong and learn to adapt to the environment around them. There will be times in life where there will be roadblocks ahead, and it is up to you to find a way the obstacles in your life.</p>
