            Social implications occurring due to wealth inequality has been an ongoing dilemma for quite some time now, stemming from the 1960s. Wealth inequality has put the hardworking middle-class people at a disadvantage with the cost of living going up as well as not being able to afford to make improvements to their current standard of living. Furthermore, it has also stagnant the growth of families as they are unable to make decisions on their future, such as investing or putting aside money for retirement. To gain a perspective, as of 2016, in the U.S., about 1 in 10 families had a negative net worth.

        <p class="bg-light px-2 pt-2 rounded-top mb-0">
            A crucial concern of wealth inequality at the economic level is the failure of reasonable pay for people to keep up with the economy's growth. Another implication would be the erosion of the minimum wage, which in turn has increased the level of poverty. Furthermore, there seems to be a significant gap between wealth among ethnicities, as White household incomes tend to accumulate more than Hispanic or African American household incomes.  As of 2017, the United States has the highest level of income inequality among the G7 nations at 0.434, which includes the United Kingdom, Italy, Japan, Canada, Germany, and France.

        <p class="bg-light p-2 rounded">
            One of the most intriguing political implications due to wealth inequality is the federal government deciding to tax capital gains and dividends at a much lower rate than other sources of income like wages and salaries, which is taxed at a rate of up to 39%. 	This implication alone by the federal government makes it clear that the rate of return on capital gains will surpass the economic growth rate, which is believed to be a crucial driver of the rise of future inequality. Also, another political implication is the lack of human rights and a people-centered approach to help combat wealth inequality as well as discrimination so, all citizens can enjoy the benefits of human rights equally.

            <p class="bg-light p-2 rounded">

                In conclusion, wealth inequality has been an ongoing dilemma ever since the 1960s and continues to be on the rise due to ignorance. One of the key reasons for wealth inequality is the lack of fair pay for American workers to keep up with the economy, which leads to not being able to make improvements to their daily lives or make future investments.  Wealth inequality has yet to get the proper recognition of being a top priority among other vital problems concerning the world. However, I believe that wealth inequality should be a top priority because it impacts our economy and many families in which poverty levels are continuing to increase.
