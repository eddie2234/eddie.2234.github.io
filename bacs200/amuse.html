    <h1>Highly Amusing</h1>
    <p>by Eduardo Garcia</p>
    
    <p>This page contains some of the things I find amusing, and it so happens to be about the different brands of clothes that I prefer to buy.</p>
    
    <h2>Hollister</h2>

        Hollister actually happens to be one of the first brands that I have been rocking with since High School. I like the unique designs and colors that they have to offer regarding shirts. They also have ripped jeans, which is probably my favorite type of jeans to wear.</p>

        American Eagle is also one of my favorite brands when it comes to shopping for clothes. I usually end up buying more button-up shirts and flannels at American Eagle. I also tend to buy more casual pants here as the pants tend to fit more comfortably.</p>

        Nike is also a favorite brand of mine, but I usually shop for shoes when I'm at Nike. There are times where I find some cool sweaters or sweatpants that I occasionally get.</p>
