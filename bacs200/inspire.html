        <p> In my eyes a hero is someone who inspires you to do push yourself. A hero has values and morals in which we seek to follow.
        Therefore, I really had to think about who is one of my heroes. </p> 
        <p> </p>
        <p> The heroes that I admire have the following characteristics. </p>
        <p> </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Leadership - always ready to take on a challenge</li>
            <li> Humbleness - someone who has a good work ethic and focused on their own future</li>
            <li> Visionary - someone who can envision the life they desire and turning it into reality </li>
            <li> Ambitious - never satisfied always wanting more for themselves</li>
        </ul>
        <p> </p>
        <p> 
        As I mentioned earlier, I really had to think about someone who met my characteristics of a hero. 
        When I sat down an thought about it for a second the first person that came to mind was Will Smith.
        He is someone who I inspire to be not only as a human being, but as a husband and as a father one day. 
        He has showned me that we often times we are going to fail at life, but with failure comes valuable life lessons. </p>
