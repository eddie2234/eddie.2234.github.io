    <P>
        In my eyes a hero is someone who inspires you to do push yourself. A hero has values and morals in which we seek to follow.
        Therefore, I really had to think about who is one of my heroes.
    </p>
    <p>
        The heroes that I admire have the following characteristics.
    </p>
    <u1>
        <1i>Leadership - always ready to take on a challenge</1i>
        <1i>Humbleness - someone who has a good work ethic and focused on their own future</1i>
        <1i>Visionary - someone who can envision the life they desire and turning it into reality</1i>
        <1i>Ambitious - never satisfied always wanting more for themselves</1i>
    </u1>
    <P>
        As I mentioned earlier, I really had to think about someone who met my characteristics of a hero. 
        When I sat down an thought about it for a second the first person that came to mind was Will Smith.
        He is someone who I inspire to be not only as a human being, but as a husband and as a father one day. 
        He has showned me that we often times we are going to fail at life, but with failure comes valuable life lessons.
